**Date:** April 26, 2025  

**Topics Covered:**
- How Java works (JVM, JDK, JRE)
- Decision-making: if-else, switch-case
- Loops: for, while, do-while
- Arrays: declaration, initialization, iteration

**Reflection:**  
Got clarity on Java's architecture. Practiced loops and explored how arrays are stored in memory. Revisiting these basics felt nostalgic and refreshing.  
Using Programiz Pro for the tutorial, files will be uploaded once I start doing projects.

### üü¢ Day 2: Methods & Strings & Completed a Rock Paper Scissors Game  
**Date:** April 27, 2025  

**Topics Covered:**
- Methods: declaration, calling, return types
- Strings: creation, methods, immutability
- Ternary operator
- Multiline comments
- Two-dimensional arrays
- Nested loops

**Reflection:**  
Gained fluency in method syntax and how Java handles strings. Nested loops + 2D arrays started to feel intuitive. The ternary operator was a compact win!  
I also made a Rock Paper Scissors game today, which was an excellent way to practice the concepts I learned.
