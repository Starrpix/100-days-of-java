## 游릭 Day 1: Understanding Java Basics  
**Date:** April 26, 2025

### Topics Covered:
- How Java works (JVM, JDK, JRE)  
- Decision-making: if-else, switch-case  
- Loops: for, while, do-while  
- Arrays: declaration, initialization, iteration

### Reflection:
Got clarity on Java's architecture. Practiced loops and explored how arrays are stored in memory. Revisiting these basics felt nostalgic and refreshing.  
Using Programiz Pro for the tutorial, files will be uploaded once I start doing projects.

## 游릭 Day 2: Methods & Strings & Completed a Rock Paper Scissors Game  
**Date:** April 27, 2025

### Topics Covered:
- Methods: declaration, calling, return types  
- Strings: creation, methods, immutability  
- Ternary operator  
- Multiline comments  
- Two-dimensional arrays  
- Nested loops

### Reflection:
Gained fluency in method syntax and how Java handles strings. Nested loops + 2D arrays started to feel intuitive. The ternary operator was a compact win!  
I also made a Rock Paper Scissors game today, an excellent way to practice the concepts I learned.

## 游릭 Day 3: Practice & Flow Control Questions  
**Date:** April 28, 2025

### Topics Covered:
- Refreshed flow control concepts  
- Solved ~40 basic Java problems (including Armstrong numbers, Harshad numbers, etc.)

### Reflection:
Spent a few hours during my free time reinforcing the basics. Focused mainly on flow control and simple logic-based problems.  
Working through classic exercises like Armstrong and Harshad numbers helped spot patterns faster.  
I aim to complete my refresher up to Strings and finish the Java Basic Practice set on Programiz. Around Day 5, I plan to refactor my Rock Paper Scissors game and apply some OOP concepts.

## 游릭 Day 4: Strings, Methods & Practice  
**Date:** April 29, 2025

### Topics Covered:
- Practiced methods, strings, and arrays  
- Learned and used `substring()` method  
- Completed Programiz Java Basic Practice Session (75 mini exercises)

### Reflection:
Realized I was starting to forget things, but this refresher really helped bring it all back.  
Learning `substring()` was fun and useful. The 75 exercises gave me strong confidence in my basics again.
