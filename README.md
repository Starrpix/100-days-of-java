# ðŸ“˜ Daily Java Learning Log

Welcome to my daily Java learning log! I'm using this log to track my progress, stay accountable, and reflect on concepts Iâ€™ve learned. Tutorials and practice primarily done via **Programiz Pro**.

## ðŸŸ¢ Day 1: Understanding Java Basics  
**ðŸ“… Date:** April 26, 2025  

### ðŸ”¹ Topics Covered:
- How Java works (JVM, JDK, JRE)
- Decision-making: `if-else`, `switch-case`
- Loops: `for`, `while`, `do-while`
- Arrays: declaration, initialization, iteration

### ðŸ§  Reflection:
Got clarity on Java's architecture. Practiced loops and explored how arrays are stored in memory. Revisiting these basics felt nostalgic and refreshing.  
Using **Programiz Pro** for the tutorial â€” files will be uploaded once I start doing projects.

## ðŸŸ¢ Day 2: Methods & Strings + Rock Paper Scissors Game  
**ðŸ“… Date:** April 27, 2025  

### ðŸ”¹ Topics Covered:
- Methods: declaration, calling, return types
- Strings: creation, methods, immutability
- Ternary operator
- Multiline comments
- Two-dimensional arrays
- Nested loops

### ðŸ§  Reflection:
Gained fluency in method syntax and how Java handles strings. Nested loops + 2D arrays started to feel intuitive. The ternary operator was a compact win!  
Built a **Rock Paper Scissors** game â€” a fun and effective way to apply the dayâ€™s concepts.

## ðŸŸ¢ Day 3: Practice & Flow Control Questions  
**ðŸ“… Date:** April 28, 2025  

### ðŸ”¹ Topics Covered:
- Refreshed flow control concepts
- Solved ~40 basic Java problems (e.g., Armstrong numbers, Harshad numbers)

### ðŸ§  Reflection:
Spent a few hours reinforcing the basics through classic exercises.  
Working on problems like Armstrong and Harshad numbers helped me spot logic patterns faster.  
Target: Complete refresher up to Strings and finish the **Java Basic Practice** set on Programiz. Planning to refactor the RPS game with OOP concepts by Day 5.

## ðŸŸ¢ Day 4: Strings, Methods & Practice  
**ðŸ“… Date:** April 29, 2025  

### ðŸ”¹ Topics Covered:
- Practiced methods, strings, and arrays
- Learned and used the `substring()` method
- Completed **Programiz Java Basic Practice** Session (75 mini exercises)

### ðŸ§  Reflection:
Started to forget a few things, but this refresher brought it all back.  
Learning `substring()` was fun and very useful.  
The 75 exercises gave me solid confidence in my fundamentals.

## ðŸŸ¢ Day 5: Object-Oriented Programming Begins  
**ðŸ“… Date:** April 30, 2025  

### ðŸ”¹ Topics Covered:
- Java OOP fundamentals
- Classes and objects
- Constructors
- Access modifiers
- Inheritance

### ðŸ§  Reflection:
Dove into the core of Java's object-oriented model. Understanding how classes, objects, and inheritance interact opened a new level of abstraction.  
Excited to apply these principles to refactor my Rock Paper Scissors game and beyond.

## ðŸŸ¢ Day 6: Practiced problem sets up to Inheritance  
**ðŸ“… Date:** May 1, 2025  

### ðŸ”¹ Topics Covered:
- Practiced OOP concepts learned so far
- Focused on class, objects, inheritance
- Briefly explored abstract classes

### ðŸ§  Reflection:
Worked through several practice problems to solidify understanding of inheritance.  
Also took a sneak peek into abstract classes â€” curious to dive deeper into them later.  
This day was more about application and internalizing the OOP foundation.

## ðŸŸ¢ Day 7: Finishing OOP & Interface Implementation  
**ðŸ“… Date:** May 3, 2025  

### ðŸ”¹ Topics Covered:
- Interfaces and polymorphism
- Data hiding & encapsulation
- `instanceof` operator
- `final` keyword
- Completed core Java OOP concepts
- Applied OOP to:
  - Refactor Rock Paper Scissors game
  - Build a simple Tic Tac Toe using arrays

### ðŸ§  Reflection:
Polymorphism and interfaces brought a whole new dimension to coding style and flexibility.  
The use of `final`, `instanceof`, and encapsulation reinforced control over data and behavior.  
Building the **Tic Tac Toe** game using arrays made everything feel cohesive. A great culmination of this week's efforts!

## ðŸŸ¢ Day 8: OOP Practice & Review  
**ðŸ“… Date:** May 4, 2025  

### ðŸ”¹ Topics Covered:
- Practiced ~20 Java OOP questions
- Reviewed core Java basics using spaced learning
- Completed **JAVA OOP** module on Programiz

### ðŸ§  Reflection:
This day was focused on spaced repetition and reinforcement.  
Practicing 20 questions helped clarify edge cases and tricky logic in OOP.  
Completing the OOP module gave me a satisfying sense of closure for the first phase of my Java journey.

### âœ… Progress So Far:
- âœ… Java Basics (Control Flow, Loops, Arrays, Strings)
- âœ… Methods & Problem Solving
- âœ… Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Interfaces)
- âœ… Projects: Rock Paper Scissors (refactored), Tic Tac Toe
